        Hello. welcome to Imani furnitures. <br>
        urniture refers to movable objects intended to support various human activities <br>
         such as seating (e.g., chairs, stools, and sofas), eating (tables), and sleeping <br>
          (e.g., beds). ... Furniture can be a product of design and is considered a form of <br>
           decorative art. <br>
           Furniture refers to movable objects intended to support various human activities such <br>
            as seating (e.g., chairs, stools, and sofas), eating (tables), and sleeping (e.g., beds). <br>
             Furniture is also used to hold objects at a convenient height for work <br>
              (as horizontal surfaces above the ground, such as tables and desks), <br>
               or to store things (e.g., cupboards and shelves). Furniture can be a product <br>
                of design and is considered a form of decorative art. In addition to furniture's <br>
                 functional role, it can serve a symbolic or religious purpose. <br>
                  It can be made from many materials, including metal, plastic, and wood. <br>
                   Furniture can be made using a variety of woodworking joints which often reflect the <br>
                    local culture.
                    People have been using natural objects, <br>
 such as tree stumps, rocks and moss, as furniture since the beginning of human civilisation. <br>
  Archaeological research shows that from around 30,000 years ago, people began constructing and <br>
   carving their own furniture, using wood, stone, and animal bones. <br>
    Early furniture from this period is known from artwork such as a Venus figurine found in Russia, <br>
     depicting the goddess on a throne. The first surviving extant furniture is in the homes of <br>
      Skara Brae in Scotland, and includes cupboards, dressers and beds all constructed from stone. <br>
       Complex construction techniques such as joinery began in the early dynastic period of ancient <br>
        Egypt. This era saw constructed wooden pieces, including stools and tables, sometimes <br>
         decorated with valuable metals or ivory. The evolution of furniture design continued <br>
          in ancient Greece and ancient Rome, with thrones being commonplace as well as the klinai, <br>
           multipurpose couches used for relaxing, eating, and sleeping. The furniture of the <br>
            Middle Ages was usually heavy, oak, and ornamented. Furniture design expanded during <br>
             the Italian Renaissance of the fourteenth and fifteenth century. <br>
              The seventeenth century, in both Southern and Northern Europe, was characterized <br>
               by opulent, often gilded Baroque designs. The nineteenth century is usually defined <br>
                by revival styles. The first three-quarters of the twentieth century are often seen <br>
                 as the march towards Modernism. One unique outgrowth of post-modern furniture design <br>
                  is a return to natural shapes and textures.[1]
